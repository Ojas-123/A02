Webstorm is an Integrated Development Environment that uses JavaScript. It houses multiple different projects and allows you to clone respositories from Github by just pasting the URL and directory of the chosen repository. You can also upload code that is already stored on your local machine. You can also just create a new project on something like Bootstrap and select a directory where the project will be stored. Webstorm will then download the necessary dependencies and set up the environment to begin coding. After that, you can begin creating anything you wish!


**Branch**: Allows you to take your work in the current "area" or branch and create an offshoot where you can test new ideas and different functionalities and then merge once they are stable and working
**Clone**: Creates a copy of the entire repository with all respective data to your local machine with all the versions
**Commit**: Almost a "Save" button that records any new changes made to a repository or branch
**Fetch**: Downloads material from a remote repository to your local one
**GIT**: Version control system that allows users to record multiple versions of code to improve debugging (similar to Google Doc edit history)
**Github**: Most widely used implementation of Git
**Merge**: Combines multiple commits together to create one piece of code
**Merge Conflict**: Different branches have competing commits and Git doesn't know which one to use in the final product
**Push**: Uploads local repository material to a remote one
**Pull**: Brings material from a remote repository to the local one
**Remote**: Similar to cloud storage vs hard drive storage; remote repositories are available to all team members of a repository while local ones are just available to the respective user
**Repository**: Stores code, files, and the version histories
